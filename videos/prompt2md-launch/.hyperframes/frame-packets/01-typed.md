## Assigned storyboard block

## Frame 1 — Typed (0.0–2.4s, ~2.4s)

- scene: Ink-black frame; the real sample prompt types itself in big mono, filler phrases tinted faint violet, a token counter climbing to 150.
- voiceover: "You write prompts like this."
- duration: 2.4s
- transition_in: cut
- status: built
- src: compositions/frames/01-typed.html
- type: hook
- persuasion: Pain validation, by direct address
- beat: recognition + tension
- blueprint: typewriter-reveal (Adapt)
- asset_candidates:
- focal: none (typography)
- roles: none
- sfx: typing
- handoff_out: the typed sheet on the last frame (2.40 s) is exactly the DOM + CSS in `.hyperframes/handoff-01-02.html`: navy ground, kicker, counter "150", the full typed prompt with its violet-tinted runs, the caret ON at the end of the hero line; scale 1, opacity 1, nothing moving at the cut. Type INTO that fixed layout (untyped characters hidden, so no line ever reflows)
- registry: none installed (offline build): hand-build the typed prompt from the `typewriter-reveal` blueprint (navy ground, cli-paper JetBrains Mono, violet-tinted filler spans, the one backspace-retype); the catalog has no paper-fold block, so the fold in 02 is hand-authored

**On screen:** full-bleed deep ink `#0F0E11`. A caret types, left-aligned in JetBrains Mono at hero size, the landing page's sample prompt, verbatim: "ok so what i need is basically a python script that takes a folder of csv files and merges them but ONLY the ones that have a "date" column, and also it should skip empty files. oh and the output should be a single parquet file. also please use pandas. actually it also needs to handle dates in different formats, some are MM/DD/YYYY and some are ISO. like i said merge them all into one parquet. also add logging. did i mention to skip empty files? yeah skip those. one more thing - if a file fails to parse dont crash, just log it and continue. use pandas like i said. thanks!!! also python 3.11". The first two lines are legible at hero scale; the rest streams faster and smaller. As they land, the phrases the real pipeline dropped tint faint violet: "ok so", "basically", "oh and", "actually", "like i said", "did i mention to skip empty files? yeah", "one more thing -", "use pandas like i said. thanks!!!". Top right, a mono counter "tokens" climbs to "150".
**Hero prop:** the sheet (here it is only text on ink; it becomes paper in 02).
**Motion:** caret typing, fast and human (a single backspace-retype on "basically" is allowed); counter ticks. No push-in: the video direction allows no slow push, and 02 opens on this exact frame.
**Seam out:** hard cut into the fold.
**Audio cue:** soft key ticks under a low synth swell.
**Constraint:** no window chrome or app frame around the text; no glitch effects.
**Why:** the hook speaks the viewer's own habit before naming the product.

**Adapt:** keep the live caret typing a relatable line, with one backspace-and-retype (Hook variant); change the payoff. Instead of collapsing to a brand pop, the typed block holds and becomes the sheet that 02 folds, so the fold is the payoff, handed across the cut.

**Word cues (frame-local s):** You 0.07 · write 0.30 · prompts 0.54 · like 0.78 · this 1.01 (line ends 1.25).

**Shot:**
- Scene 1 (0.00–0.35s): full-bleed navy ground. The kicker "◣ YOUR PROMPT" (top-left, `cli-slate`) and the counter label "tokens" with "0" (top-right, mono) are already in place; the caret blinks at the line start (left ~8%, top ~20% of frame). **type-on with caret** (`discrete-text-sequence` + `context-sensitive-cursor`) starts at 0.05 s.
- Scene 2 (0.35–1.25s): on "You write prompts", the hero line types at a fast human pace in `cli-paper` mono, hero size: "ok so what i need is basically a python script that takes a folder of csv files". One **backspace-and-retype** on "basically" (types "basicly", deletes two characters, retypes "ally"). Filler phrases tint faint violet as they land. The counter climbs in step with the characters (`counting-dynamic-scale`, the number only, no size growth). Asymmetric editorial layout: hero line ~84% width, upper half.
- Scene 3 (1.25–2.20s): on "like this", the rest of the prompt streams in below at small size, dimming toward the bottom (texture, not for reading); the counter lands on exactly "150" as the stream finishes (~2.0 s).
- Scene 4 (2.20–2.40s): hold, the caret blinks once and is ON from 2.30 s, so the last frame matches the handoff. Hard cut.

## Selected blueprint: typewriter-reveal

# typewriter-reveal — Typewriter Reveal

**intent**: A live text caret types (and edits) a line as a human would, then either collapses it to a point and pops a brand payoff, or holds it under a persistent brand mark while a sub-line types/swaps into the final CTA — making "someone is typing this" the engine of the shot.

**roles served**

- Hook (from hook-typed-line-to-reveal): Type a relatable question/statement live, then COLLAPSE it and spring-pop the brand — a logo lockup OR a product-UI moment ("here's the everyday pain, now here's us").
- Brand_Outro (from brand-outro-persistent-mark-cta-rail): Hold the hero mark dead-center/top the whole shot while a sub-line beneath it swaps or types its way into the final CTA — landing the ask once the logo is already established.

**duration**: 3.6–7s (Brand_Outro 3.6–6.0s · Hook 5.5–7s)

**shot structure** (one consolidated template; `[slots]` are product-agnostic)

- Scene 1 (0.0–~2.0s): On a solid `[bg color]` field, a blinking text-input caret `|` sits at the line start, then `[primary line]` TYPES on character-by-character with the caret trailing.
  - _Variant — Hook_: nothing else is on screen; the typed `[hook line]` owns the frame. (Sub-variant: the line types inside UI chrome — a rounded `[input/pill]` — and the whole assembly continuously TRANSLATES leftward + scales slightly so the active caret stays pinned near frame-center while earlier words scroll off and clip past the left edge — a ticker push.)
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro_: a `[logo mark]` (+ optional `[wordmark]`) is already centered/upper and STAYS fully visible for the entire shot; an entry flourish plays on the mark itself (e.g. `[checkmark/icon]` strokes into the mark, or thin concentric rings ripple outward from it), and the typed `[tagline / product label]` is the SUB-LINE beneath the mark.

- Scene 2 (~2.0–4.5s): The typed line is MODIFIED in place — the active text is edited rather than re-shot.
  - _Variant — Hook_: final word(s) BACKSPACE out and a new word RETYPES (`[word A]` → `[word B]`), or the fill/caret snaps to `[accent color]` on the final word. Holds briefly.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro_: the sub-line is REMOVED in place — a direct hard CUT/replace (NO backspace) or a moving mask-WIPE erases it — while the mark performs a small idle move (gentle rotate / sparkle reposition); the mark never leaves frame.

- Scene 3 — resolve:
  - _Variant — Hook (collapse, ~0.3–0.7s)_: caret vanishes; the whole text/assembly COLLAPSES to a point at center (horizontal X-collapse or scale-to-0 zoom-out) and disappears, leaving a clean `[bg]`. Then (remainder) a centered `[brand element]` SPRING-POPS in:
    - _logo-lockup sub-variant_: a `[mark/icon]` pops, then slides aside as a `[wordmark]` UNMASKS / slides out from behind it; both settle into a centered lockup.
    - _product-UI sub-variant_: a `[UI control]` (e.g. button) pops; a `[cursor]` sweeps in from a corner and homes onto it; on contact a ~150ms state-FLIP — base cross-fades to `[accent color]`, icon inverts, and a soft radial GLOW blooms outward and persists.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro (~4.5s–end)_: the final `[CTA]` resolves in the sub-line slot — TYPED in with a caret and/or shown as a `[CTA in accent-color button]` beside plain text; an optional `[accent color]` GLOW ring / halo settles around the persistent mark. Holds to end. Final frame: `[logo mark]` + (glow ring) + `[CTA]`.

**motion vocabulary**: blinking text caret; character-by-character type-on; backspace-and-retype OR in-place hard-cut/mask-wipe text swap; optional leftward ticker push (assembly translates to keep caret centered); persistent centered hero mark (never vanishes) with entry flourish (icon stroke-draw, concentric ripple rings) and small idle move (rotate / sparkle); X-collapse / scale-to-0 zoom-out of the typed line; spring-pop brand reveal; wordmark unmask-slide into lockup; cursor sweep + UI state-flip + radial glow bloom; accent glow/halo ring settle; pill/button CTA reveal; hold.

**rule mapping** (per motion verb → `rules/<id>.md`)

- blinking text caret → `context-sensitive-cursor` (caret color-switch + blink)
- character-by-character type-on → `discrete-text-sequence` (typing/typos/holds/backspace); recipe `gsap-effects` (typewriter)
- backspace-and-retype → `discrete-text-sequence`
- in-place hard-cut / replace text swap → `discrete-text-sequence` (whole-text state swaps)
- mask-wipe erase of sub-line → `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (run in reverse)
- leftward ticker push (assembly translates to keep caret centered) → `camera-cursor-tracking` (viewport follows a moving caret)
- persistent hero mark hold → no motion rule needed (static anchor; intentional — it's the absence of motion)
- entry flourish: icon stroke-draw into mark → `svg-path-draw`
- entry flourish: concentric ripple rings from mark → `cursor-click-ripple` (ripple bloom)
- small idle mark move (rotate / sparkle reposition) → `sine-wave-loop` (idle)
- X-collapse / scale-to-0 zoom-out of typed line → `scale-swap-transition` (closest fit — it morphs/collapses elements at a shared center; approximation, since a standalone collapse-and-vanish without the paired same-center brand pop isn't its exact case)
- spring-pop brand reveal → `spring-pop-entrance` (alt `physics-press-reaction`)
- collapse-text → pop-brand as a same-center morph pair → `scale-swap-transition` (morph two elements at same center)
- wordmark unmask-slide into lockup → `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (unmask); slide via `spring-pop-entrance`
- cursor sweep onto UI control + press → `cursor-click-ripple` (cursor→target press + ripple)
- UI state-flip (base/icon invert on contact) → `hacker-flip-3d`
- radial glow bloom / accent glow-halo ring settle → `asr-keyword-glow` (accent glow); ring expansion via `center-outward-expansion`
- pill/button CTA reveal → `spring-pop-entrance` (alt `scale-swap-transition`)

**camera modifier**: none required — camera is static for both roles. The Hook ticker push is an ELEMENT translate (the typed assembly slides leftward to keep the caret centered), not a camera move → modeled by `camera-cursor-tracking` rather than a true camera rule.

# Context-Sensitive Cursor

In a typewriter sequence, the cursor's color (and optionally height / blink behavior) matches the **active text segment** — brand accent while typing the brand name, dim on placeholders, success color on the completion mark. The eye lands on the keyword being typed because the cursor shifts with it; a fixed single-color cursor is visual noise by comparison. Layers on top of [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md)'s SEQUENCE pattern.

## How It Works

The text is authored as a SEQUENCE of `{ t, text, segment, color }` entries; a linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches for the current entry and writes both the visible text and the cursor's `background` (the cursor is a colored block, so `background`, NOT `color`). A second linear tween sweeps a phase `p` through `2π × BLINK_CYCLES_PER_SCENE` and gates cursor opacity on `sin(p) > 0` — a deterministic square-wave blink on the timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* proportional fonts drift the cursor mid-segment */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  white-space: pre; /* preserve trailing spaces — cursor sits at segment end */
}
.text {
  white-space: pre;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width/height */
  width: {cursorWidth}px;
  height: {cursorHeight}px;
  background: {textColor}; /* default — overridden per segment in onUpdate */
  vertical-align: {cursorBaselineFix}px; /* small negative — anchor to baseline, not line-height */
}
```

```js
// Adjacent entries usually share a text prefix but may differ in `segment` —
// that's what shifts the cursor color mid-line.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0, text: "", segment: "main", color: "{mainColor}" },
  { t: T_LEADIN_END, text: "{leadInChunk}", segment: "main", color: "{mainColor}" },
  { t: T_BRAND_IN, text: "{leadInBrandPrefix}", segment: "brand", color: "{brandColor}" },
  { t: T_BRAND_OUT, text: "{leadInBrandFull}", segment: "main", color: "{mainColor}" },
  { t: T_CMD_IN, text: "{leadInCmdPrefix}", segment: "cmd", color: "{cmdColor}" },
  { t: T_SUCCESS, text: "{leadInDone}", segment: "success", color: "{successColor}" },
];

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i];
  }
  return SEQUENCE[0];
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: DURATION,
    duration: DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      textEl.textContent = entry.text;
      cursorEl.style.background = entry.color;
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Deterministic square-wave blink
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES_PER_SCENE,
    duration: DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Non-blinking during active typing** — suppress blink while letters are appearing (solid cursor), resume on idle. This MUST be a pure function of the driver's time: tracking a mutable `lastChangeTime` in `onUpdate` is not reverse-seek-safe (scrubbing backwards leaves the stale forward-pass value behind and the cursor blinks — or holds solid — at the wrong frames). Bake the change times from the SEQUENCE instead — every entry whose `text` differs from its predecessor is a typing event:

```js
// Baked once at build time — no runtime state.
const CHANGE_TIMES = SEQUENCE.filter((e, i) => i > 0 && e.text !== SEQUENCE[i - 1].text).map(
  (e) => e.t,
);
// In onUpdate — identical result at any seek, either direction:
const isTyping = CHANGE_TIMES.some((t) => t <= driver.t && driver.t - t < TYPING_GRACE);
cursorEl.style.opacity = isTyping ? "1" : Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
```

- **Cursor HEIGHT shifts on segment** — larger cursor on the brand segment: `cursorEl.style.height = entry.segment === "brand" ? cursorHeightEmphasis : cursorHeight` (1.1–1.25×; more reads as glitch).
- **Contrast reversal** — a dark-text-on-light segment needs a dark cursor too; keep `entry.color` as the single source of truth and read from it.

| entry `t` spacing      | 0.2–0.5s micro-additions    | ascending, non-uniform — slow down on highlights                                                |
| segment palette        | 3–4 colors max              | more reads as random; brand vs success should differ in saturation/luminance                    |
| cursorWidth / Height   | 8–24px / 0.85–1.0× fontSize | too thin vanishes in render compression; too tall outranks the text                             |
| cursorBaselineFix      | small negative px           | drop the block to the text baseline                                                             |
| BLINK_CYCLES_PER_SCENE | period ≈ 0.6–1.2s           | **whole number** — otherwise the sin sweep ends mid-cycle and the cursor pops on the last frame |
| TYPING_GRACE           | 0.15–0.3s                   | **< shortest dwell between adjacent entries** — otherwise the cursor never blinks               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Cursor color goes on `background`** — it's a colored block, not a glyph.
- **Blink is timeline-driven sin, pure of any mutable tracker** — the typing-grace variation shows the seek-safe form.
- **`white-space: pre` on text and container** — collapsed trailing spaces park the cursor in the wrong column.
- **Monospace font + `display: inline-block` cursor** — proportional faces drift the cursor mid-segment; inline ignores the block geometry.
- **BLINK_CYCLES_PER_SCENE is a whole number** for the fixed DURATION.

# Counting with Dynamic Scale

A number counts from A → B while its transform scale grows to the final size — escalating visual weight ("this is impressive") without tweening `font-size` or forcing text layout on every frame. The final font size is static CSS; only the transform changes.

## How It Works

Two synchronized tweens at the SAME timeline position with the SAME ease: (1) a proxy value rendered as text via `onUpdate` (`Math.round(...).toLocaleString()`), (2) the counter's transform `scale: START_SCALE → 1`, where `START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE`. A suffix (`%`, `×`, `+`) slides in AFTER the count lands — the number gets its own beat — and a label fades in early.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="counter-wrap">
  <span class="counter" id="counter">0</span><span class="counter-suffix">{suffix}</span>
</div>
<div class="counter-label">{label}</div>
```

```css
.counter-wrap {
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  justify-content: center;
  width: {counterContainerWidth}; /* fixed width — no layout shift as digit count changes */
}
.counter {
  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; /* MANDATORY — digits keep equal width */
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: {endSize}; /* final size is static; GSAP animates scale, not font-size */
  transform-origin: center center;
}
.counter-suffix {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(20px);
}
```

```js
const counter = document.getElementById("counter");
const state = { value: 0 };
const START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE;

// Count value — onUpdate changes text only
tl.to(
  state,
  {
    value: TARGET_VALUE,
    duration: COUNT_DUR,
    ease: COUNT_EASE,
    onUpdate: () => {
      counter.textContent = Math.round(state.value).toLocaleString();
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Visual growth — compositor transform sharing the count's timing + ease
tl.fromTo(counter, { scale: START_SCALE }, { scale: 1, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE }, 0);

// Suffix slides in AFTER the count completes
tl.to(
  ".counter-suffix",
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUFFIX_DUR, ease: `back.out(${SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  COUNT_DUR,
);

// Label fades in early
tl.from(".counter-label", { opacity: 0, y: 12, duration: LABEL_DUR, ease: "power2.out" }, LABEL_AT);
```

## Variations

- **Direct `innerText` tween (no proxy)** — GSAP can tween `innerText` directly for a number-only counter; keep the proxy form when you need locale formatting or suffix logic. The scale tween stays separate either way:

```js
tl.to(
  counter,
  { innerText: TARGET_VALUE, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE, snap: { innerText: 1 } },
  0,
);
```

- **3D depth entry** — add a `tl.from(".counter", { z: -300, ... }, 0)` push-in; requires `perspective` on `.counter-wrap` and `transform-style: preserve-3d` on the counter.
- **Multi-stat coordinated reveal** — 3 stats counting in parallel share the SAME ease, duration, and start position so they finish together (a chord, not an arpeggio). Each stat usually also needs a paired graphic (bar / ring / stars) — don't stop at the number; see [stat-bars-and-fills.md](stat-bars-and-fills.md).

## Values

| START_SIZE / END_SIZE | START ≈ 40–60% of END                       | design inputs used once for START_SCALE; never tween either                   |

| SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR  | 1.4–2.0                                     | overshoot is fine on the suffix (it's punctuation, not data)                  |
| LABEL_AT / LABEL_DUR  | AT < COUNT_DUR/2; 0.4–0.7s                  | label arrives before the count peaks                                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **`tabular-nums` mandatory** + fixed-width container as belt-and-suspenders — without them digit-count transitions (9 → 10 → 100) jitter as glyph widths change.
- **Never set `fontSize` in `onUpdate`** — final type size is static CSS; only the transform changes per frame. Keep `onUpdate` O(1): set text only, no style writes or DOM creation.
- **`Math.round`, not `Math.floor`** — halfway through the final integer should already display the final value.
- **Avoid `back.out` / `elastic.out` on the counter itself** — overshoot makes the number look unstable (it's data, not decoration). Grow in place, don't bounce.
- **Label is BIG TEXT, not a page-style caption** — a tiny paragraph under a hero-size number reads as visual noise in video. Display-size, uppercase, tracked: the label is part of the headline.

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

## Values

| token               | range                                        | notes                                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE  | 48–96px                                      | full-bleed comps; smaller for terminal-style detail                    |
| TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH | ≥ widest state                               | measure with a hidden probe after `document.fonts.ready` if unsure     |
| milestone `t`s      | keystrokes 0.06–0.20s apart; pauses 0.3–0.6s | monotonically increasing; `T_DONE ≤ TOTAL_DURATION − ~1s` climax dwell |
| TYPE_DUR (smooth)   | `chars × 0.06–0.12s`                         | fast → relaxed                                                         |
| BLINK_CYCLES        | one cycle per 0.5–0.8s                       | `TOTAL_DURATION / 0.8 ≤ BLINK_CYCLES ≤ TOTAL_DURATION / 0.5`           |
| CURSOR_WIDTH        | ~0.3× font size                              | gap to text single-digit px so the cursor feels attached               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.
